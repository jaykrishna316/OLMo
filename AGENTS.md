## 🚨 AI Policy & Operations

Extracted from CONTRIBUTING.md - operational constraints and procedures.

### AI Policy

- When you're ready to contribute code to address an open issue, please follow these guidelines to help us be able to review your pull request (PR) quickly.
- The most direct way is with the [`venv` module](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html) in the standard library, but if you're new to Python or you don't already have a recent Python 3 version installed on your machine,

### Key Requirements

- Finally, you'll need to create a Python 3 virtual environment suitable for working on this project. There a number of tools out there that making working with virtual environments easier.
- If your contribution involves additions to any public part of the API, we require that you write docstrings

### Development Procedures

- and description.  The description should include as much relevant information as possible.  The description should
- code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior.
- This means that your local clone can only track changes from your fork, but not from the main repo, and so you won't be able to keep your fork up-to-date with the main repo over time. Therefore you'll need to add another "remote" to your clone that points to [https://github.com/allenai/LLM.git](https://github.com/allenai/LLM). To do this, run the following:
- we recommend [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- On Mac, for example, you can install Miniconda with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):



## 🧠 Machine Learning Architecture

This is a machine learning or model training system.

### Key Components

- **Data Pipeline:** Data loading, preprocessing, augmentation
- **Model Definition:** Architecture, hyperparameters, checkpoints
- **Training Loop:** Loss calculation, gradient updates, validation
- **Inference:** Model predictions, batch processing, latency optimization
- **Evaluation:** Metrics, benchmarks, comparison to baselines

### Critical Areas

1. **Data Leakage:** Ensure train/test/validation splits are isolated
2. **Reproducibility:** Set random seeds; version datasets and models
3. **Resource Management:** Monitor memory, GPU usage during training
4. **Versioning:** Track model checkpoints, hyperparameters, and results
5. **Evaluation Rigor:** Use proper metrics; avoid optimizing to test set

### Testing Strategy

- **Data Pipeline Tests:** Verify shape, type, and value ranges
- **Model Tests:** Check predictions with synthetic/known inputs
- **Training Tests:** Verify loss decreases on toy datasets
- **Inference Tests:** Check latency and memory usage
- **Regression Tests:** Compare results against baseline models



## 🏗️ Architecture & Context Guide

This section provides architectural context and agent-understanding for the codebase.

### Prerequisites

- **Python:** >=3.10 (or applicable language version)
- **Package Manager:** pip or uv
- **Test Runner:** pytest

### Architecture Overview

#### Key Components
- **Main Entry:** Standard layout
- **Test Suite:** 231 test files
- **Build Configuration:** Makefile, pyproject.toml, pyproject.toml

#### Design Principles

1. **Modularity** - Code organized by functionality with clear separation of concerns
2. **Testability** - Comprehensive test coverage across critical paths
3. **Clarity** - Explicit naming and structure for AI agent understanding
4. **Consistency** - Uniform patterns and conventions throughout codebase
5. **Maintainability** - Well-documented code with clear intent

### Directory Map

| Directory | Purpose |

| `scripts/` | Build and utility scripts |
| `tests/` | Test suite |


### Development Workflow

#### Initial Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allenai/OLMo
cd OLMo
pip install -e .
# or
uv sync --all-groups
```

#### Development Commands

**Running Tests:**
```bash
pytest                    # Run all tests
pytest tests/             # Run specific test directory
pytest -v                 # Verbose output with test names
pytest -x                 # Stop on first failure
coverage run -m pytest && coverage report  # With coverage report
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
ruff check .              # Lint with ruff
ruff format .             # Format code
mypy .                    # Type checking (if configured)
```

### Code Style & Conventions

- **Naming:** Use snake_case for functions and variables
- **Type Hints:** Yes (strongly encouraged)
- **Error Handling:** Yes - handle errors at boundaries; let exceptions propagate when another layer owns recovery
- **Logging:** Yes
- **Testing:** Yes - write tests alongside code changes

### Testing Strategy

**Framework:** pytest
**Test Files:** 231 found

Before committing:
1. Run the full test suite: `pytest`
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Check type hints: `mypy .`
4. Format code: `ruff format .`

### Writing Documentation

When updating docs:
1. Always include explanatory text before code snippets
2. Describe *why* and *what* before showing *how*
3. Keep sections focused on a single concept
4. Use clear, concrete examples

## Known Gotchas & Warnings

- The most direct way is with the [`venv` module](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html) in the standard library, but if you're new to Python or you don't already have a recent Python 3 version installed on your machine,
